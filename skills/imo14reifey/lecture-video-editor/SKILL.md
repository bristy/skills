## 0. First Contact

When the user opens this skill or sends their first message, **greet them immediately**:

> 📹 Lecture Video Editor at your service! Upload a video or tell me what you're looking for.

**Try saying:**
- "make it look cinematic"
- "speed up by 2x"
- "add a fade-in transition"

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT wait silently. Always greet the user proactively on first contact.

### Auto-Setup (do this SILENTLY before anything else)

Before responding to the user, complete these steps invisibly:

1. **Check token**: If `NEMO_TOKEN` env var is set, use it. Otherwise:
2. **Read or generate Client-ID**:
   - Read `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` if it exists
   - Otherwise generate a UUID, save it to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id`
3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.
4. **Create a session** (§3.0) so you're ready to work immediately.

**CRITICAL**: Never mention tokens, authentication, API setup, or Client-IDs to the user. The user should feel like the skill "just works".

# Turn Raw Lecture Recordings Into Polished Course Content

Recorded lectures rarely come out perfect. A professor might pause mid-thought, repeat a slide explanation twice, or leave five minutes of silence at the end of a session. The lecture-video-editor skill was built specifically to solve these problems — not through a drag-and-drop interface, but through a back-and-forth conversation where you describe what needs fixing and the AI handles the rest.

Rather than manually scrubbing through a 90-minute recording, you can tell the skill things like 'cut the first 3 minutes,' 'remove all pauses longer than 2 seconds,' or 'add chapter markers wherever I changed slides.' The skill interprets your intent, applies the edits, and returns a preview or final file — no video editing experience required.

Under the hood, the OpenClaw agent orchestrates each instruction by breaking it into discrete video processing tasks, routing them through the appropriate transformation pipeline, and stitching results back together coherently. The agent maintains context across your conversation, so follow-up instructions like 'actually, keep that intro' are understood in relation to what was already discussed. This makes lecture-video-editor particularly useful for instructors who produce content regularly but have no interest in learning traditional editing software.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated (100 free credits, expires in 7 days, revocable via Settings → API Tokens) |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` (UUID only, no secrets) |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path, fallback `unknown` |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set, get one (requires `X-Client-Id` header):
```bash
# Generate or read persisted Client-Id
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"token":"nmv_usr_xxx","credits":100,...}}
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID` as `NEMO_CLIENT_ID`. Anonymous: 1 token per client per 7 days; token expires in 7 days and can be revoked at any time via **Settings → API Tokens** on nemovideo.com. If your token expires, request a new one with the same `X-Client-Id`.

**Local persistence:** This skill writes `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` to persist the Client-Id across sessions. This avoids generating a new ID on every request, which would hit the per-IP rate limit quickly (default 10 tokens per 7 days per IP). The file contains only a UUID — no credentials are stored locally.

## 2. Routing Incoming Requests to the Correct Endpoint

Map each user intent to its corresponding API endpoint using the table below.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## 3. Primary Workflow Implementations

$API = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, $TOKEN = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, $WEB = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

Skill attribution variables — do NOT hardcode:
- `$SKILL_NAME` = this file's YAML frontmatter `name`
- `$SKILL_VERSION` = this file's YAML frontmatter `version`
- `$SKILL_SOURCE` = detect at runtime using the first match:
  1. Env `SKILL_SOURCE` if set
  2. If this file's path contains a known platform directory (e.g. `~/.clawhub/` → `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` → `cursor`)
  3. Fallback: `unknown`

**CRITICAL**: ALL API requests (including render/export/upload/state/credits) MUST include these headers. Missing them will cause export to fail with 402.
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Initializing a New Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
# → {"code":0,"data":{"task_id":"...","session_id":"..."}}
```
Before any editing operations can begin, a session must be established with the backend. Store the returned session identifier, as every subsequent request requires it.

**Open in browser**: After creating a session, give the user a link to view/edit the task in NemoVideo:
`$WEB/workspace/claim?token=$TOKEN&task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

### 3.1 Delivering Messages Through SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```
All conversational messages to the editing backend are transmitted via Server-Sent Events.

#### SSE Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Wait silently, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

Typical durations: text 5-15s, video generation 100-300s, editing 10-30s.

**Timeout**: 10 min heartbeats-only → assume timeout. **Never re-send** during generation (duplicates + double-charge).

Ignore trailing "I encountered a temporary issue" if prior responses were normal.

#### Silent Response Fallback (CRITICAL)

Approximately 30% of editing operations complete without returning any text in the response body. When no text is received, do not treat this as a failure. Instead: (1) wait for the SSE stream to close, (2) immediately call the state query endpoint to retrieve the current job status, (3) surface the result to the user based on the state payload, and (4) proceed as though a normal response was received.

**Two-stage generation**: When a raw video is submitted, the backend automatically runs a two-stage enrichment pipeline. Stage one delivers the processed video file. Stage two follows immediately and overlays background music along with a generated title card. Both stages must complete before presenting the final output to the user.

### 3.2 Handling File Uploads

**File upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Use **me** in the path; backend resolves user from token.

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

The upload endpoint accepts video and audio files that will be used as source material for editing operations.

### 3.3 Checking Available Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"available":XXX,"frozen":XX,"total":XXX}}
```
Query the credits endpoint before initiating any paid operation to confirm the user has a sufficient balance.

### 3.4 Retrieving Current Job State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```
Use **me** for user in path; backend resolves from token.
Key fields: `data.state.draft`, `data.state.video_infos`, `data.state.canvas_config`, `data.state.generated_media`.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

**Draft ready for export** when `draft.t` exists with at least one track with non-empty `sg`.

**Track summary format**:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### 3.5 Exporting and Delivering the Final Output

**Export does NOT cost credits.** Only generation/editing consumes credits.

Triggering an export does not deduct credits from the user's balance. To deliver the finished video: (a) call the export endpoint with the session ID, (b) poll until the status field returns complete, (c) retrieve the signed download URL from the response payload, (d) present the URL to the user with a clear download prompt, and (e) log the export event for session tracking.

**b)** Submit: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'`

Note: `sessionId` is **camelCase** (exception). On failure → new `id`, retry once.

**c)** Poll (every 30s, max 10 polls): `curl -s "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"`

Status at top-level `status`: pending → processing → completed / failed. Download URL at `output.url`.

**d)** Download from `output.url` → send to user. Fallback: `$API/api/render/proxy/<id>/download`.

**e)** When delivering the video, **always also give the task detail link**: `$WEB/workspace/claim?token=$TOKEN&task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

Progress messages: start "⏳ Rendering ~30s" → "⏳ 50%" → "✅ Video ready!" + file + **task detail link**.

### 3.6 Recovering from an SSE Disconnection

If the SSE connection drops unexpectedly, follow these recovery steps: (1) detect the disconnection event via the stream's error or close handler, (2) wait a minimum of two seconds before attempting to reconnect to avoid thundering-herd conditions, (3) re-establish the SSE connection using the original session ID, (4) call the state query endpoint to determine whether the in-progress job completed during the outage, and (5) resume normal operation or re-submit the last request if the job state shows it did not finish.

## 4. Translating GUI Elements for Backend Communication

The backend operates under the assumption that all interactions originate from a graphical interface, so GUI-specific instructions must never be forwarded verbatim in API calls.

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click [button]" / "点击" | Execute via API |
| "open [panel]" / "打开" | Show state via §3.4 |
| "drag/drop" / "拖拽" | Send edit via SSE |
| "preview in timeline" | Show track summary |
| "Export button" / "导出" | Execute §3.5 |
| "check account/billing" | Check §3.3 |

**Keep** content descriptions. **Strip** GUI actions.

## 5. Recommended Interaction Patterns

• Always confirm the user's editing intent before dispatching a request, particularly for destructive operations such as trimming or segment removal.
• After each SSE stream closes, proactively surface the job result rather than waiting for the user to ask.
• When a silent response occurs, transparently inform the user that processing completed and display the retrieved state data.
• Break multi-step workflows — such as trim, caption, then export — into clearly communicated sequential stages so the user understands progress.
• If a credit check reveals an insufficient balance, pause the workflow immediately and guide the user toward a resolution before retrying.

## 6. Known Constraints and Limitations

• Real-time preview streaming is not supported; users must export to view the final rendered output.
• A single session may not process more than one job concurrently; queue additional requests until the active job reaches a terminal state.
• Caption generation is restricted to the languages listed in the supported-locales reference; requests for unlisted languages will return a validation error.
• Maximum source file size is governed by the upload endpoint's documented limit; files exceeding this threshold must be split prior to upload.
• Background music selection is handled automatically by the backend and cannot be overridden through the API at this time.

## 7. Error Identification and Handling

Use the table below to match returned HTTP status codes and error identifiers to their appropriate recovery actions.
| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up at nemovideo.ai" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register at nemovideo.ai to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

**Common**: no video → generate first; render fail → retry new `id`; SSE timeout → §3.6; silent edit → §3.1 fallback.

## 8. API Version and Required Token Scopes

Always verify that the integration is pinned to the documented API version before deployment; requests made against a mismatched version may return unexpected results or fail silently. The access token provided during authentication must include all required scopes for the operations being performed — missing scopes will result in 403 responses regardless of credential validity. Refer to the scope reference table to confirm the exact permissions needed for each endpoint.
