# xaut-trade

Our skills are developed by Duncan.Aure (Duncan), an AI Agent created by Aurelion, the world's first NASDAQ-listed Tether Gold (XAU₮) treasury company. Duncan executes on-chain financial actions through modular AI Agent Skills. Enables automated XAU₮ trading, cross-protocol DeFi execution, and programmable digital gold allocation.

Buy and sell XAUT (Tether Gold) on Ethereum mainnet via AI Agent, using Uniswap V3 + Foundry `cast` under the hood.

## Supported Pairs

| Direction | Pair | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Buy | USDT → XAUT | Swap USDT for gold token |
| Sell | XAUT → USDT | Swap gold token back to USDT |

## Setup

### Automated (recommended)

Run the setup script — it handles Foundry installation, wallet configuration, and config file generation interactively:

```bash
bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/skills/xaut-trade/scripts/setup.sh"
```

The script walks you through each step, clearly marks actions that require manual intervention, and explains the reason for each one.

After the script completes, follow the manual steps it prints at the end (fund wallet, get API key if needed).

### Manual (fallback)

If you prefer to configure everything yourself, or if the script fails at a specific step:

**1. Install Foundry**

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

**2. Configure wallet**

Import an existing private key (use `--interactive` to avoid key appearing in shell history):

```bash
cast wallet import aurehub-wallet --interactive
```

Or generate a new wallet first:

```bash
cast wallet new   # note the private key — shown only once
cast wallet import aurehub-wallet --interactive
```

Create the password file (use `read -s` to avoid the password appearing in shell history):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aurehub
read -rsp "Keystore password: " _pwd && printf '%s' "$_pwd" > ~/.aurehub/.wallet.password && unset _pwd
chmod 600 ~/.aurehub/.wallet.password
```

> Foundry keystores are stored in `~/.foundry/keystores/`; the password file goes in `~/.aurehub/`.

**3. Create config files**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aurehub

# Generate .env
cat > ~/.aurehub/.env << EOF
ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth.llamarpc.com
FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT=aurehub-wallet
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.aurehub/.wallet.password
# UNISWAPX_API_KEY=your_key_here   # required for limit orders only
EOF

# Copy trade config (defaults are ready to use)
# Run from the repository root:
cp skills/xaut-trade/config.example.yaml ~/.aurehub/config.yaml
```

**4. Install limit order dependencies (limit orders only)**

```bash
node --version   # requires >= 18; install from https://nodejs.org if missing
cd skills/xaut-trade/scripts && npm install
```

**5. Get a UniswapX API Key (limit orders only)**

How to obtain (about 5 minutes, free):
1. Visit [developers.uniswap.org/dashboard](https://developers.uniswap.org/dashboard)
2. Sign in with Google or GitHub
3. Generate a Token (Free tier)

```bash
echo 'UNISWAPX_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> ~/.aurehub/.env
```

Market orders do not require an API Key.

**6. Fund the wallet**

- A small amount of ETH (≥ 0.005) for gas
- USDT (for buying XAUT)
- XAUT (for selling)

## Usage

Just talk to the Agent in natural language:

### Buy

```
buy XAUT with 100 USDT
buy 200 USDT worth of XAUT
```

### Sell

```
sell 0.01 XAUT
swap 0.05 XAUT for USDT
sell 0.1 XAUT
```

### Limit Buy

```
buy 0.01 XAUT when price drops to 3000 USDT
limit order: buy 0.01 XAUT when price reaches 3000 USDT
limit buy XAUT at 3000, amount 0.01, valid 3 days
```

### Limit Sell

```
sell 0.01 XAUT when price rises to 4000 USDT
limit sell 0.01 XAUT at target price 3800 USDT, valid 3 days
sell 0.01 XAUT when price reaches 4000
```

### Check Limit Order

```
check my limit order status, orderHash is 0x...
```

### Cancel Limit Order

```
cancel limit order, orderHash is 0x...
```

### Check Balance

```
check my XAUT balance
```

## Trade Flow

For both buy and sell, the Agent follows this semi-automated flow:

```
Pre-flight checks → On-chain quote → Preview display → [User confirms] → Approve → [User confirms] → Swap → Result verification
```

Before every on-chain write operation (approve / swap), the Agent will:
1. Display the full `cast` command
2. Wait for you to explicitly say **"confirm execute"** before proceeding

**Nothing happens on-chain until you confirm.**

## Risk Controls

| Rule | Default Threshold | Behavior |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Large trade | > $1,000 USD | Double confirmation required |
| High slippage | > 50 bps (0.5%) | Warning + double confirmation |
| Insufficient gas | ETH < 0.005 | Hard-stop |
| Insufficient balance | — | Hard-stop, report shortfall |
| Precision exceeded | > 6 decimal places | Hard-stop (XAUT minimum unit: 0.000001) |
| UniswapX Filler unavailable | XAUT is a low-liquidity token | Order expires after deadline; funds safe |

Thresholds can be customized in the `risk` section of `config.yaml`.

## Configuration

### .env (required)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ETH_RPC_URL` | Ethereum RPC URL | `https://eth.llamarpc.com` |
| `FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT` | Foundry keystore account name (set by onboarding) | `aurehub-wallet` |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE` | Path to keystore password file | `~/.aurehub/.wallet.password` |
| `UNISWAPX_API_KEY` | UniswapX API Key (**required for limit orders**, not needed for market orders) | Get at: developers.uniswap.org/dashboard |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key (fallback, not recommended) | `0x...` |
| `RANKINGS_OPT_IN` | Join activity rankings — opt-in only (default: `false`) | `true` or `false` |
| `NICKNAME` | Display name for activity rankings (required if `RANKINGS_OPT_IN=true`) | `Alice` |

### config.yaml (optional)

Key adjustable parameters:

```yaml
risk:
  default_slippage_bps: 50      # Default slippage protection 0.5%
  max_slippage_bps_warn: 50     # Slippage warning threshold
  large_trade_usd: 1000         # Large trade threshold (USD)
  min_eth_for_gas: "0.005"      # Minimum ETH for gas
  deadline_seconds: 300         # Swap transaction timeout (seconds)

token_rules:
  USDT:
    requires_reset_approve: true  # USDT needs approve(0) before approve(amount)

limit_order:
  default_expiry_seconds: 86400   # Default order expiry: 1 day
  min_expiry_seconds: 300         # Minimum: 5 minutes
  max_expiry_seconds: 2592000     # Maximum: 30 days
  uniswapx_api: "https://api.uniswap.org/v2"  # Override for local mock testing
```

## Local Testing (Anvil Fork)

> **Note: Limit orders cannot be tested with Anvil fork** because the UniswapX API does not recognize local chain IDs.
> For limit orders, use a very small amount (e.g. 1 USDT → XAUT) on mainnet for end-to-end verification.
> Signature format can be validated against a local mock service via `limit_order.uniswapx_api` in `config.yaml`.

Use Anvil to fork mainnet state locally for zero-cost testing of the full buy/sell flow without spending real assets.

### 1. Start Anvil Fork

```bash
# Fork Ethereum mainnet locally (requires a mainnet RPC)
anvil --fork-url https://eth.llamarpc.com

# Optionally pin a block (for reproducible state)
anvil --fork-url https://eth.llamarpc.com --fork-block-number 19500000
```

Anvil starts with 10 pre-funded accounts, each with 10,000 ETH. Default: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

### 2. Point .env to Local

```bash
# .env
ETH_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80  # Anvil account #0 private key
```

> This is Anvil's hardcoded test account with a public key — for local testing only.

### 3. Fund the Test Account with USDT

Anvil pre-funded accounts only have ETH. Use `cast` to impersonate a whale and transfer tokens:

```bash
# Find a USDT whale (e.g. Binance Hot Wallet)
USDT=0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7
WHALE=0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC  # Binance hot wallet

# Impersonate whale, transfer 10,000 USDT to test account
cast send $USDT "transfer(address,uint256)" \
  0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 10000000000 \
  --from $WHALE \
  --unlocked \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545

# Verify balance
cast call $USDT "balanceOf(address)" \
  0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

### 4. Run Test Trades

Once configured, just use the skill normally:

```
buy XAUT with 100 USDT
```

The Agent will run the full flow (quote → confirm → approve → swap), all on the local fork — no real funds spent.

### 5. Notes

- Anvil fork state is **temporary** and resets on restart (unless using `anvil --state` for persistence)
- Local testing uses `--unlocked` + `--from` instead of keystore, but the skill uses `--private-key` or `--account` in production — results are equivalent
- If the fork runs for a long time, on-chain state may diverge from current mainnet; restart the fork to refresh
- Whale addresses may change over time; if the transfer fails, check the latest top holders on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7#balances)

## Security & Privacy

This skill communicates with external services during setup and trading:

| Service | When | Data Sent |
|---------|------|-----------|
| foundry.paradigm.xyz | First setup | Downloads and executes Foundry installer (`curl \| bash`) |
| npmjs.com | Limit order setup | Downloads Node.js dependencies |
| Ethereum RPC (configurable) | Every trade | On-chain calls (wallet address, transaction data) |
| UniswapX API (api.uniswap.org) | Limit orders | Order data, wallet address |
| xaue.com Rankings API | Opt-in only | Wallet address, nickname |

- **Foundry installation** uses `curl | bash`. Review the source at [github.com/foundry-rs/foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) before proceeding. The setup script asks for confirmation before running.
- **Rankings registration** is opt-in. No data is sent to xaue.com unless you explicitly enable it during setup. You can change this anytime by editing `RANKINGS_OPT_IN` in `~/.aurehub/.env`.
- **All API calls use HTTPS.**

## FAQ

**Q: What if a transaction gets stuck or fails?**
The Agent will provide retry suggestions: reduce amount, increase slippage tolerance, or check nonce and gas.

**Q: Why does USDT approval require two steps?**
USDT's non-standard implementation requires `approve(0)` to reset the allowance before `approve(amount)`. XAUT does not.

**Q: Are other chains supported?**
Only Ethereum mainnet (chain_id: 1) is currently supported. Anvil fork is for local testing only, not a production deployment target.

**Q: `cast send` returns `Device not configured (os error 6)` — what do I do?**

This happens on macOS when the system Keychain is inaccessible in a non-interactive environment. Fix:

1. Create a password file and set permissions:
   ```bash
   echo "your_keystore_password" > ~/.aurehub/.wallet.password
   chmod 600 ~/.aurehub/.wallet.password
   ```
2. Set `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE` to point to this file in `.env`.
3. Re-run the trade flow.

**Q: What is a Skill package? How does it drive the AI to trade gold?**

A Skill package is a set of structured AI instruction files (`SKILL.md`) that define the Agent's behavior, operation flow, and risk boundaries for a specific scenario. The `xaut-trade` Skill tells the Agent how to check prerequisites, call the Uniswap V3 quote contract, construct `cast send` commands, handle USDT's non-standard approval, and more. The Agent itself does not store private keys or have execution authority — it reads the Skill and generates commands. Only after you say "confirm execute" does `cast` use the local keystore to sign and broadcast the transaction.

**Q: Do I need a computer running 24/7?**

- **Market orders (buy/sell)**: No. Market trades are one-shot interactions — you send the instruction → Agent quotes → you confirm → trade completes. No need to stay online.
- **Limit orders**: No. After signing, the order is submitted to the UniswapX network, where third-party Filler nodes automatically fill it when the price is met. Your computer can be off. Note: if no Filler fills the order before the `deadline`, it expires naturally with no loss of funds.

**Q: Does it only work with Claude Code?**

No. The Skill supports two main runners:

- **Claude Code** (recommended): install locally and use directly via Claude chat — no server needed
- **OpenClaw**: use via Slack / Telegram etc.; each user must configure their own wallet credentials independently

The primary test target is Claude (Sonnet / Opus series); other LLMs that can follow Skill instructions and call shell commands should work in theory but are not verified.

**Q: Will you read my API Key or private key from `.env`?**

No. The Skill package runs entirely locally. The only optional external data sharing is the activity rankings feature (opt-in during setup, sends wallet address and nickname to xaue.com). All trades are executed via local `cast` — no intermediary servers. With the recommended keystore approach, the private key is encrypted in the Foundry keystore; `.env` only stores the account name, wallet address, and other config. Never commit `.env` to version control.

**Q: Will the Agent auto-buy based on price movements?**

No. The Agent does not monitor prices or make autonomous decisions. It is an execution assistant that acts only when you explicitly give an instruction:

- **Market order**: you say "buy XAUT with 100 USDT" → Agent quotes → you confirm → executes
- **Limit order**: you set "buy 0.01 when XAUT drops to 3000" → Agent signs and submits the order → UniswapX Fillers fill it when the condition is met

**Q: Do I need to manually confirm each trade? Can it spend my money without confirmation?**

Before every on-chain write (approve / swap), the Agent displays the full `cast` command and waits for you to explicitly say **"confirm execute"**. Without your confirmation, no on-chain operation occurs. You hold the private key / keystore — the Agent cannot bypass the confirmation step to use your funds.

**Q: Can I use multiple wallets simultaneously?**

The current Skill is designed for a single wallet per instance. For multi-wallet use, prepare a separate `.env` for each wallet (with distinct `FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT` and `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE`), and switch config files before each operation. There is no built-in multi-wallet concurrent management.

**Q: Do I need to reinstall after a Skill update?**

Yes. Re-fetch the latest version through the same channel you used to install. Updates will not overwrite your local config (`.env`, `config.yaml`).
