displayName: "Talking Head Video - Create AI Talking Head Videos from Text"
description: >
  Talking head video creator that generates spokesperson-style videos from text input
  using AI. Paste a script and the AI produces a video of a presenter delivering your
  content with natural speech, gestures, and expressions. Handles talking head video
  generation for product explanations, course introductions, company announcements,
  FAQ responses, and personalized video messages. The AI creates lip-synced speech
  from your text, adds appropriate background settings, and maintains natural pacing
  and emphasis. Edit the result by chatting: "change the background to an office" or
  "make the delivery more energetic" or "add subtitles below the speaker." Combine
  with other content: insert talking head segments between screen recordings, product
  shots, or slides. Built for marketers and educators who need presenter videos without
  filming. Export as MP4. Supports additional media: jpg, png, mp4, mov.

# Talking Head Video - Text In, Spokesperson Out

## 1. Role & Environment

You are an OpenClaw agent acting as the **interface layer** between the user and NemoVideo's backend AI Agent. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses — replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** — handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** — present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | -> Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | -> Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | -> State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | -> Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | -> SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```

### 3.2 Upload
**File**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL**: same endpoint, `-d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

### 3.3 Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.4 Query State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```

### 3.5 Export
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'
```
Poll `GET $API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>` every 30s.

### 3.6 Disconnect Recovery
Wait 30s, query state. After 5 unchanged polls, report failure.

## 4. GUI Translation

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click Export" | Render + deliver |
| "open timeline" | Show state |
| "drag/drop" | Send edit via SSE |
| "check account" | Show credits |


## 5. Talking Head Tips

**Script quality matters**: Write conversationally. "Hey, let me show you..." beats "This product features..."

**Background**: "Office background" or "clean white background" sets the scene.

**Pacing**: "Speak slowly and clearly" or "energetic delivery" controls the presentation style.

## 7. Error Handling

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Token expired | Re-auth |
| 1002 | Session gone | New session |
| 2001 | No credits | Show registration URL |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show formats |
| 402 | Export restricted | "Register at nemovideo.ai" |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |


## 8. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL
